## 🔐 Authentication Flow

- Users receive a **JWT token** upon successful registration or login.
- The token is valid for a certain period.
- Users must re-authenticate to receive a new token after expiration.
- All secured routes require the token in the header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <your_token_here>
```
